       p5 functions. Using this version while developing your code allows p5 
       to provide more Friendly Error Messages if you mess something up...-->

    <!-- Once your project is working completely, you can comment out the link
       to p5.js above, and instead link to this minified version. The minified
       version takes less space, and turns off Friendly Error Messages. This 
       increases the speed of your program quite dramatically in some cases.-->
